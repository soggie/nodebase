# nodebase

Real simple boilerplate-ish thing I use to standardise all ES6/7/8 work that I do in node.

## To use

````
$ cd <working directory>/..
$ git clone git@github.com:soggie/nodebase.git
$ cd ../<working directory>
$ cp ../nodebase/gulpfile.js .
````

Yeah it's that simple. The rest is just code for testing and stuff. Will add more scripts to it in the future.
